While our FTE 2x in 2022, this year we will only grow by 2-3 people. As chief of staff, for me this means that I will be wearing many more hats than usual. For example, with zero security background, I'll now be acting compliance officer and be owning things like SOC2 & HIPAA certifications. For myself and many on the leadership team (CEO included), this is our first time operating a company at this scale. I'd like to work on the following:
1) coaching myself, our CEO and those around me through new waters (most likely within the fields of strategy, operations and finance)
2) improving mastery of execution and prioritization while moving with urgency
3) balancing my role between operations and strategy as a chief of staff and making sure I am continuously learning, improving and adding value in both arenas.","In thinking back on one great achievement of my career, I found that I don't often intentionally reflect on the work that I put in and opportunities that I sought out to get to where I am today. I've always felt that I had more to learn and more to achieve. Without a background in tech or finance, I started my career as an early stage VC. The learning curve was steep and I spent 6 years progressing my knowledge, involvement and eventual ownership of deals. However I knew that as I assessed companies and sat on boards, I lacked real practical, operational experience at a fast-growing startup. I took about a year to carefully assess which company I'd like to jump ship to, and after making the move I've been hooked to the excitement, fast-pace and culture found at many accelerating startups ever since. Being behind the scenes requires a level of excellence in execution, prioritization, and ownership, and I would love to continue expanding my skills here.

I hope that my positive attitude and willingness to learn from and also challenge the mentor will make for interesting conversations for both parties.",,"I would be grateful to work with someone who has been through a Series B fundraise and beyond, and who has experience either working in operations or with a chief of staff.

I'm ready to build out and own the BP function (which I did at my previous job so have experience in doing so). What makes this company different and where I'd love some mentorship:
1. This company has had some trauma with some ex-leaders and their missteps; we also had a nonprofitable year last year and had to receive quite a bit of tough love and even some role eliminations recently. Trust is hard to win over, particularly in the Customer Success functional area, where they've been at the root of the drama. I have been working to build trust and to start putting patches on problems, but the team is very tight-knit (especially when they are protecting one another, but unfortunately when there's something/someone they're unfamiliar with rocking the boat). I'd love to work on strategies to build authentic trust while also moving at the pace that the company needs, which is of course much faster than I've been experiencing so far. 
2. The other two members of my team are Head of People and Senior L&D. Because I'm more boots on the ground and doing most of the generalist work, I sometimes feel like I'm not getting an equal chance to build out the docs and processes; I'm less likely to lead an education session in management sessions but I want to. I'm navigating how to be both the voice of the people and also literally writing down these takeaways to help the company at large; I'm less able to see the forest through the trees and I'd like to work on how to balance that better. 
3. Ultimately: I love helping people uplevel and unlock their skillsets. As I'm looking towards regaining the BP title at this company, I know I'd also want to be a people manager again as this company grows. I really believe that me having a mentor would be an excellent way to receive the type of coaching and support that I'd like to provide others! ","I work tirelessly to build DEIB programs that folks can opt into as much or as little as they want to. As long as the company is committed to being an open, safe space for all - I've done my job. 

I've been blessed to see folks BLOOM within the safety of the ERGs at work. Perhaps the most meaningful to me was an older colleague who confided in me about being trans but being afraid to bring that side of her to work (she was still masking in men's clothes; was an Eng leader and was afraid of losing trust from her teammates). It was a huge crossroads in her life and she told me that she felt like, if she committed to it and knew she had my support, she could feel safe to ease her way into making that announcement to the company someday. We spent time breadcrumbing appropriate learning opportunities about trans issues to the company, who were gracious learners, via our Queer ERG. She and I built some informational pages and workshopped how she'd make the announcement; on the back-end, we worked together to get her name changed in the HRIS and our other systems. The day she came out to the company was one I'll never forget - every single person in the company reacted with sweet words congratulations and support! Even folks I wasn't sure about made it a point to offer their support and praised her bravery to let the company in on her real self. I played defense (for lack of a better term) for her and fielded questions that were genuine and cautious. For many folks at the company, this was their first experience being colleagues and friends with a trans person, and I felt like the work that went into that process was something that will live so much longer than just that workplace, that's a moment that we'll all have for life and will hopefully ripple into their personal lives, for the better. ","I've been told that I'm a joy to work with because I bring my authentic self to the table. I will absolutely make you laugh and can deflate tension in a meeting; I commit to presenting in different learning styles and degrees of gregariousness to match the audience. 
I'm not afraid to be vulnerable and share my experiences to give color to how I might genuinely understand what you're going through; I have a gift for making people feel safe enough to open up to me. 
I prioritize finding sustaining solutions for individuals, so that we have more stable teams and a genuinely happier company. I work tirelessly to ensure that this happens but in a way that feels effortless to others. 
 I recently attended a live HR conference and it was reiterated back to me several times that I have a genuine gift to resonate organically with people and I have genuinely fun, creative ideas to make normal processes feel elevated and palatable. Where they suggested I hone in was simply on how I can harness these skills and apply them to the specific job that I have now. I've worked at much bigger places and at a similarly sized but more cohesive and psychologically safe company, but this company I'm having a harder time deciphering what they need first and how I can continue to slowly earn their trust.

I would cherish a mentor to help me find places to focus that inertia for my own career so that I can be most effective in helping others' careers (""you have to put your own oxygen mask on first"" type sentiment). ",,"I am a queer, neurodivergent leader who's side kick is doing stand-up comedy. I'm not who people might envision as a typical HR professional, but I find that therein lies my strength. I'm able to appeal to a whole different group of people who might not feel seen by ""typical HR"" folks. I'd be over the moon to have a mentor who was either queer or neurodivergent!

I'm looking for help in structuring that program and prioritizing partners in a more scaleable manner.","I was the founding Product Marketing hire at CallRail 6 years ago, and building and scaling that function from a team of one (me!) to a team of 6 was the greatest accomplishment of my career so far.

In my first year in this role my primary function was acting as a generalist marketer and covering gaps in the team (ex: Field Marketing) as well as project managing design and development for all projects. 

In FY'23 the nature of my role has shifted entirely. We have been able to hire and onboard experts to continue to build out the functions I was covering in 2022. I am now playing the role of a more traditional Program Manager and focusing heavily on our team's operating model.

1. Operating an excellent team-- Learning about processes that work, but aren't over-engineered for operating a Marketing team.
2. Improving partnership with leadership-- in this new chapter of my role, partnering with our Head of Marketing and team leads is a major part of my work. Building confidence in myself and my work and improving my communication skills would be hugely valuable. ","A specific accomplishment I am incredibly proud of from my time at Retool was my work during what is referred to internally as ""The Summer of Retool"". The Summer of Retool was a period of ~12 weeks where as a Marketing team we completed four product launches (and many product releases), three webinars, our first-ever 3rd party tradeshow, a fundraising announcement, the release of our free plan, AND as a culmination, our first-ever high production quality live event to preview a new product. 

It was a lot. Managing all the design and development needed to accomplish all of that (with only external agencies) was a massive undertaking. One that, if you told me I had to do again, I might run and hide. What resulted was an incredible cross-functional effort, an exciting new muscle of shipping a lot at once, and a profound sense of accomplishment. 

As a project manager, helping others' work shine is a big part of my role. Being critical to the success of so many projects and launches allowed for a sense of pride, accomplishment, and recognition that I have felt in few other endeavors.

2. Identify skill gaps I can shore up to best position myself 
3. Create a plan to beta test the next role to confirm it’s a good fit","SUCCESSFULLY LEADING A COMPANY-WIDE ENGINEERING PROJECT
My greatest career accomplishment thus far has been spearheading the engineering effort to ensure MainStreet’s business continuity from 2022 to 2023 (https://mainstreet.com). This involved working with many stakeholders to clarify requirements, creating design docs, building scripts/test infrastructure, deploying/running those scripts in production, and diagnosing and resolving any resulting bugs.

WHY THIS WAS PERSONALLY IMPACTFUL
To be recognized in an engineering capacity was HUGE for me because I have taken a non-traditional career path to get to where I am (CFP → PM → Eng).

Additionally, I believe a good mentor-mentee relationship involves

Our focus was helping the elderly and immunocompromised  during the shelter-in-place order, and we ultimately built technology to help deliver over 2,000,000 meals

After we first launched an online bulletin board for individual users to help one another, we learned a couple of key insights:

1) Signing up the elderly/immunocompromised was much more difficult 
2) Most people were requesting food assistance
3) The reimbursement process was difficult

Using these three insights, I implemented a partnership strategy.
We partnered with:
1) Health plans in order to access thousands of elderly folks in need of food assistance
2) Food banks in order to get access to literal tons of free non-perishables and produce. 
3) Delivery providers like Uber, Lyft, and Axle Hire.

These partnerships allowed us to pivot the product to a software platform for food-banks to manage a list of food recipients, then schedule and track batched food delivery runs to deliver essential food supplies to people for free. It was the most rewarding product-related experience of my career.

I gained valuable experience in pivoting an entire organization in a new direction (much easier said than done) using a combination of storytelling and metrics.

I recognized the parts of the work I loved about branding (holistic design, end-to-end user experiences, problem-solving, etc.) were not only integral to product design work, but also carried over into my approach to product in general: mostly, how someone interacts with a product will be reflective of the brand as a whole. 

The pivot meant that I needed to emphasize and make use of my transferrable skills, and as a result, required I display extra confidence in their transferability. That being said, confidence does not come naturally to me, so it necessitated that I build that confidence in myself and recognize and believe in my existing strengths.

For a while, promotions came frequently, growth was a given, and now we're at the phase where growth takes more time, more diligence, and is not guaranteed unless you work at it. I have experiences navigating ambiguity, I've done strategic work, but I haven't had the chances to do it often and do it over and over again until I can do it easily. For now, strategic thinking is still something that takes time, and is a muscle I'm trying to strengthen. To that end, I would love to work with a mentor who can guide me through this ""put it in the oven, and let it bake"" period of my career. Things I would love to work on:
1. Getting stakeholder buy-in for narrative/storytelling work - this is an area where I've had some success in the past, but it takes me some time to get buy-in. I pride myself on great customer empathy and acumen and will have a sense of what needs to be communicated, but I've struggled with justifying why I've landed on a particular narrative or storytelling.  Sometimes I'll go through rounds with my team where we try other approaches first, and then land on an approach I had initially proposed through trial and error. Would love to work on how I can build confidence in my proposals from the start, or build those proposals in a way that communicates how I got there.
2. Frameworks to quickly bring order to chaos - when given a really ambiguous challenge, I will figure out what we need to do, but it currently takes me some time. I often feel like I have to noodle until inspiration strikes. I'd love to codify the process for breaking down large ambiguous problems into bite-sized, actionable pieces.
3. Self-advocacy - how to communicate my impact effectively

I came into this work without any retail or e-commerce experience, was the only PMM on this product for almost 3 years and involved with every piece of the growth of this product.

A. I spent the first 6+ years of my career at consumer e-commerce company (ShopStyle) & B2B2C marketplace (ShopStyle Collective), eventually acquired by Rakuten, in both mid-level IC and early product leadership roles.

B. Following that to expand my experience & opportunities, I moved to SaaS & B2B marketplace companies for 4+ years (LiveRamp & Karat) where I was in product leadership roles leading teams of entry-to-senior level product managers with up to 6 years of PM experience. ***Based upon this, I've actually had great experiences mentoring PMs earlier in their product careers (and those looking to move into product management from cross-functional areas) and would be keen to do a dual track as a mentor with the First Track program as well if you see mentees that could be a good pairing with my mentorship experience.

C. Most recently, I’ve recently transitioned into a staff level IC product role at a smaller consumer company (Babylist) that’s in an interesting position as it was bootstrapped by our incredible former software engineer, female founder over a decade ago and only as recently 2021 raised $40M led by Norwest to make strategic investments in growth and establish the right board to provide guidance towards IPO.

WHY I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH A FIRST ROUND MENTOR: 
The company is actively recruiting for a CPO, and the product organization has quickly scaled from being 3 people to over 10 following the capital investment creating an interesting “growing pains” dynamic in addition to the new influx of great ideas & talent.  During my recruiting process, I expressed that I’d be happy to join as an IC to start with the intention of finding the right management role aligned with my PM people-management strengths once the CPO and organizational dust settles.  

In practice though, I’ve never been trained with the strategies to maneuver office politics and advocate for myself in the most effective ways to find the right place amidst lots of organizational change; as such, I’d love to work with a mentor that can help me:

1) strategize how to exercise my muscles of self-advocacy tactics with my current experience & strengths with C-suite leadership & Board advisors
2) “manage up” more effectively (currently without a CPO in place, my existing manager is a peer)
3) identify growth opportunities to round out my skills and capabilities that can help me build an even more successful and fulfilling career. ","While I didn’t study computer science nor was I formally educated in a technical discipline, my work ethic and curiosity have driven me since the early stages of my career to work tirelessly to develop my technical fluency to work closely with my engineering partners as an effective product manager bringing my product intuition, user empathy, and data analytics background to guide strategy. I didn’t want not having that formal technical background to be my handicap, and I’m extremely proud of how far I’ve come in this regard.

I first took that opportunity to push myself technically at ShopStyle, where after starting as a young data analyst who’d never written a single line of code, I was able to help do the iterative, scrappy work to convince my leadership team to invest and allow me to create a strike team & strategy to build out ShopStyle Collective (a B2B2C marketplace) from a “maintenance mode” MVP with hundreds of active users to a thriving mature product and business that boasts a network of +20k top creators, influencers, & publishing API partners driving hundreds of millions in sales to +1.4k e-commerce retail partners. The success of the ShopStyle Collective business & product attracted Rakuten to acquire the company, which is undoubtedly one of the accomplishments I am most proud of in my career.

I pushed myself again in an even bigger way technically when I moved into the extreme technical complexity of the Adtech ecosystem at LiveRamp where I was a Product Director and had to develop the technically fluency from scratch in understanding identity graph resolution, consumer privacy compliance, the connectivity of massive amounts of consumer data through integrations with FAANG to hundreds of startups. ","I think a mentor would be excited to work with me because: 
1. I’m really thirsty to learn from others’ real experiences and perspectives. 
2. I’m open to guidance and feedback. 
3. I’m quite organized and can provide thorough context & meeting agendas that will lead to fruitful conversations. 
4. The type & leveling of mentorship I’m proposing would offer them a unique mentorship opportunity. 
5. I’d hope and imagine that discussions with me could lead to serving the mentor in their own professional goals and objectives in participating in the Fast Track Mentorship program. 
6. I’d be happy to mutually provide “mentor feedback” in that regard if it’s helpful.
7. I also think that my network would be an extremely valuable asset to any Mentor(s) who I might be paired with.",,"I’d love to be paired with a mentor who has founder/C-suite level leadership experience and can help me develop a strategy to advocate for myself with leaders at that level and identify opportunities where I can round out my skills and network to create an even more successful & fulfilling career.

With all of this in mind, as an extreme-nice-to-have (while I’m very open to learning from any number of folks with different experiences & backgrounds), if it were possible, as a woman of color and child of immigrant refugees (who don’t have the generational pedigree & network that many of my peers do), I’d love to work with a Mentor who can empathize and/or has experience as an ally of women of color in tech.

Additionally, I am a single mother of a young child. To be frank, this makes any changes in my career feel particularly scary as I have a toddler-aged daughter to support, who I hope will grow up to look at me as an inspiring role model both in life and career.",,,,Female,Southeast Asian,1

3. Understanding what it means to be a head of talent. Right now, I am operating as an IC but my company sees a future where I take on more responsibility outside of FLC recruiting. ","While I was at Persona, we grew the engineering team from 30 engineers to 80 in 1 year. This enabled not only the business to grow faster, but it also reduced a lot of burnout from the engineer's that were there before I started. With our VP of engineering, we rolled out a full interview process for 8 different engineering roles where initially it was the same process and same questions asked. We created preparation material for all the roles, a full interviewer process with shadowing, and hiring manager training which, for the size of our company, was beyond what I thought was capable.  ","I personally feel like I have a lot of room to grow in the recruiting space. I have a background in ecommerce, b2b and b2c/d2c but I don't feel like I'm an expert in any single area.

1. Learning how to level up a team. I managed PMs the last est. half a year and it is ok for the team I am at. What I want to get insights into is how to build a learning roadmap for each member, develop them best and how to level up management when the team doubles.
2. I see a lot of resources on product strategy but a strong lack of resources on execution which is a key area to be successful for us. Hence, I would like to bounce off some ideas to improve execution, especially as this involves different teams from engineering to marketing and CS. 
3. Working best with the management. I am moving more in a spot to work with our C-level (deeper than before), VPs of other departments, and investors.

I am never the same I was the day before and want to grow a long way (sustainably, I'm not really a guy for all that fake BS out there tbh).

I would like to improve, or learn more about the following:

1.) I would like to understand the industry of recruiting more clearly. Recruiting roles, duties, and expectations all vary by industry (i.e. in-house recruiting, technical recruiting, college outreach/recruitment within corporate companies, non-profit recruiting, etc.). While podcasts and articles have been very helpful on my educational journey of learning more about this field, I would like to go further. I hope to feel more confident in my understanding of the hard and soft skills that are needed to succeed and flourish within this task and industry.

2.) I would like to learn how to tend to the needs of my entire team without losing my inner voice. My favorite part of working within the HR and People Operations industry is that I am working to help my team feel more comfortable and safe within their work environment, while simultaneously learning from, with, and about each team member on a human and professional level. However, while serving others it's important to not forget your own value as well. You are definitely meeting your goal if your entire team is winning. It's of crucial importance that the entire team wins, and it's also important for you to win -- because you are apart of the team, too.

3.) Transferable skills are vital for the growth and success of every professional, because it demonstrates to themselves and to others that they are multifaceted and are continuously seeking out growth opportunities. It also demonstrates that they have interests and curiosity for projects and opportunities outside of the tasks that are typically asked of them. More importantly it shows that an individual has drive for innovation and isn't afraid of change. 

Lastly, during this mentorship I would appreciate being introduced to conversations and tools that will help inform me of the transferable skills (hard and soft) that are required when working in a corporate office environment, a bigger team, and a very large candidate pool (when recruiting). Working on a small team where team members are kind, and hold space for one another, within a space that welcomes, encourages, and expects curiosity, work, and proposals that demonstrate how you've thought outside of the box -- looks a lot different from a bigger or more corporate environment. This isn't to say that one is good or bad, negative or positive -- but the environments and cultures within each setting are quite different from one another. I would like to be prepared for this transition if and when the time comes.
","The greatest accomplishment of my career thus far was obtaining my role at Range Mediation and Consulting and Mission Bit. When I graduated alongside my Mom and received my Bachelor's Degree a few years ago, I had planned on working with people and advocating for underrepresented communities, but I didn't imagine that it would look the way it does today. Multiple individuals around me while growing would highlight parts of my personality that exemplified leadership tendencies -- and it always confused and bothered me. Deep down, I appreciated those words, but I couldn't fully relate to those words. Eventually, when I grew into a teenager I told my mom that, ""I wish that I could see what everyone else sees in me"". I would also tell her how I didn't want to be a leader. I would say how, ""I want to graduate from college, earn a great job that will pay me well and make me happy, and help my kids with college so they can go on - and do what they are meant to do in life"". That's what I wanted. I would say it again and again. The words, ""I don't want someone to work under me. I wouldn't know what to do! I want to make a life for my kids, so they have opportunities like that!"" continuously rolled off of my lips. That was until I graduated with my BA and went on to grad school.

Fast forward to 2023 where I can proudly say that I've worked and currently work with amazing, humble, and curious individuals who are confident in asking for my input, contribution, and work on discussions, projects, and assignments that I've studied for and completed, as well as tasks and duties that I've either on a few times or have never tried at all. 

From a quiet young girl who didn't even realize, and couldn't acknowledge that the majority of her goals, ideas, and projects that centered on mentoring, helping, and fending for others were actually signs of leadership, to a woman who is the head of recruitment for young instructors, listens to/and helps guide youth with their own goals, and communicates with top corporate and tech companies for outreach opportunities. All I can say is that these two roles are the greatest accomplishments of my career, and because of them I don't view the sky as a limit anymore.","A mentor will be excited to work with me, because I am okay with being myself, and because I like who I am. When an individual like who they are, amazing things take place. Both, big and small.

Secondly, I am a very curious individual. I don't agree with some of the assumptive stereotypes that have been made about millennials. I understand the stereotypes, but I don't agree with them. While millennials were raised within a major technology boom -- we didn't all turn out as selfish, spoiled, or entitled beings. I can't speak for everyone else, but growing up within the technology boom fed my curiosity, daily. When I wanted to learn more about Egyptian history I'd talk with Mom, then my Grandma, and I learned from them and then they'd help me online through Ask Jeeves-- where I learned even more. When I wanted to learn about Scottish myths I Googled it. On the fourth day of an internship, when I wanted to dive deeper into discovering the ins and outs of foundational skills that are needed to succeed in Public Relations I ordered a book about it on Amazon.

Everything that I know today, from the difference in salary wages between American and Canadian public school teachers, why traditional animation is continuously outsourced from American studios to Canadian and South Korean studios, coral bleaching, to dyscalculia, how a mother's DNA changes after childbirth, and the need for open and equitable spaces for deaf individuals within the tech industry. It all stems from my willingness and need to learn more.

I am constantly wondering about the individuals around me, the individuals in other countries, sea mammals and other creatures within our oceans. The people who came before me and the people who will be here when I'm gone. My own communication style. The communication, and thinking habits of children. Blacklisted leaders. The list will always continue, because I care about this world, I care about my world and my people (POC), and I care about others.

In closing, everything that I know, and everything that I am comes from my interest for people, cultures, topics, discussions, industries, and initiatives that have nothing to do with me. It comes from the individuals who've taught me, and communities who continue to pour into me. You don't have to leave the country to be cultured. You don't have to be an MD, an engineer, a Pulitzer Prize writer, a celebrity, or hold a college degree to understand that we are all connected, and that giving, learning, and mindful curiosity will help the world to go on, for generations to come.",,"I would like to be paired with a mentor who is kind, caring, mindful,  courageous, and also curious. A mentor who is happy to do this work.

As a woman of color, I am aware that the Bay Area is not what it used to be. The culture of the Bay Area has changed, and the local natives who once lived here and the local visitors who spent a good portion of their time here, have all grasped the fact that this space of comfort and familiarity isn't the same. Today, POC aren’t quite sure what question, discussion, or engagement that seems simple will lead to. More often than not, a certain type of armor is needed to get through the day when navigating the streets and spaces of the Bay Area (when you come from a Brown or Black community).

I hope and would like to be placed with a mentor who will embrace and appreciate my curiosity, potential, and hope for this opportunity, just as much as I will embrace and appreciate their time, knowledge, and the gift that they are sharing with me.

If given the opportunity, I hope that I will be placed with a mentor that won't require me to possess any armor.",,,,Female,African-American/Black,1

Daniel,Nazarian,Mentee,No,,No,CTO,Get Twenty,Operator,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nazarian/,EST,"Boca Raton, FL - close to Miami, FL",Finance,"Marketplaces,PropTech",3-4,0,1-5,"I'm a multi time failed entrepreneur - none VC funded, all built and funded by myself and/or co founders. I typically serve in more a CEO role and long term that is my goal.

Recently, I've started working on a new start up (www.gettwenty.com) with a friend of mine where he is dealing with sales/marketing and I'm more dealing with CTO responsibilities - i.e., building out our MVP and all that.

It's a vague and big list but I think these are the three main points I need to work on:

1. I think I've gotten solid enough at the IC/tech side of things - I really want to work on my managerial skills, building a tech team and managing it. I feel ready to do this but haven't been able to build the opportunity to do so. Get Twenty could get there at some point though so it feels like a great opportunity to focus on that.

2. When I've served as CEO, I've tried to really be on top of sales and marketing efforts as well. While I feel I'm relatively on top of these - and practice makes perfect - I do feel like I've fallen short in other business/finance skill sets. I've learned a lot from friends and books over the years about VC funding but the idea of it still scares me and I'm not very educated in other forms of funding. I had one business where I was looking to get a grant to fund some big ideas we had and I just kept pushing it back until it just never happened.

3. I think I need to get a bit better at product strategy and getting feedback. I think I'm relatively okay at this, my first 'real' start up BitBite was built around doing this, however, I also think as the 'builder' I still have a perfectionist streak I can't seem to get rid of. The technical side of me just gets too scared.

In my opinion, I think point 2 is my biggest. I know a lot about building tech products and while I haven't lead a big team myself, I have a lot of experience project leading and working with more junior developers. At this point I think I need to really figure out how to get them out there and growing.","My start up BitBite - it started in college as purely a test app that garnered so much interest I started adding more features and things until it was a real business.

BitBite started as an app to help people find places to eat and grew into a 'restaurant digitization platform' aimed at helping small restaurants and chains easily and inexpensively digitize their business. We offered rewards services, online ordering, a POS and order management system and application, and much much more. All built in house by myself.

I served as CEO and CTO, I had two cofounders that helped with sales and operations and while it ultimately failed I am really proud of how much we were able to build and how many people we were able to get give us a chance.

We were actually doing pretty well in my view - we had around 6 customers in my college town we were going to start charging but then COVID started and they sadly all went out of business. We kept trying to get in touch with small businesses, however, in hindsight, it was impossible for me and my two cofounders to compete with our incredibly well funded competition - like Caviar and Toast - that were ready to pounce.",I wish I knew!,,"Whatever you guys think is best - maybe someone who's similar a CEO/CTO combo?

I want an adviser who has previously been an operator in an early-stage start-up and can provide the following mentorship: 

1) Productive discussion on identifying and guiding to product-market fit and monetization strategies from both a pragmatic and creative lens 

2) Guidance on the intricacies of navigating accelerators, early-stage investments, and timelines for raising funds  ","I broke into the fashion industry in New York without a network within a few months. Previously in advertising technology in San Francisco nine years ago, I found a white space in the luxury industry (fashion, beauty) where there was a gap in understanding how digital and luxury could synergistically work to drive revenue. 

Today, as VP of Marketing, I was part of the 7-member founding team to lead the marketing growth strategy for beauty company VIOLETTE_FR (owned by renowned French makeup artist Violette). I was involved in strategy and execution across the board, from operations and product marketing to launching the global website in March 2021. As a point of differentiation in the already saturated beauty market, I strategized a core value of the founder not to use beauty to ‘fix yourself’ into a marketing initiative by connecting mental health and beauty with the action of “Shop by Mood” on the website. ","I was once described as ‘understated quirky’: at first, it’s not obvious, but the more you get to know me, the more you’ll be pleasantly surprised by my unconventional ideas and actions. 

I am building a product to simplify gift giving with a twist. I believe giving gifts is a language that is not only misunderstood but often overlooked. On the surface, TERA will make your life easier through lists, but in reality, it’s advertently teaching you how taking the time to give gifts from curated lists builds meaningful connections. 

My non-linear path from pre-medicine to tech sales to fashion/beauty marketing has enabled me to cross-pollinate ideas from non-adjacent industries to drive impactful strategies. Innately curious and observant of trends, I offer a fresh perspective to building a scalable consumer product that is modern, frequently utilized, and community-led. 

Whether it’s marathon training or executing a go-to global marketing strategy, I passionately dive into a task at hand to completion. I don’t see challenges as barriers but rather as opportunities that motivate me to think differently.

I am excited for a mentor to help me build the foundation for my next journey as a founder of a successful company. ",,"I am most compatible with mentors who were previously or are currently forward-thinking operators with a perspective from the trenches of the day-to-day building and running of a start-up. Outside of technical and operational mentorship, I want a strategic soundboard who can help me further think outside the box with their wide range of industry experience. As a creative problem solver, I am looking for a mentor who is process-oriented and comfortable thinking differently.

I would love to be paired with a seasoned mentor who knows how to balance creating structure while having a cultured and diverse point of view driven by an appetite to learn and experience more.

Almost all my technical learning has been through shipping quickly, so I want to improve technical 

1) Maximizing the speed of my technical growth, and building confidence in my technical abilities. I've been known to ship quickly and often, but putting company goals first meant focusing less on developing my craft. Thinking back to my time at Sourcegraph, larger and more technical projects would scare me.
2) Figuring out how to best leverage my mix of technical skills and business interests and experience. For the first year and a half at Sourcegraph, I led all marketing and growth efforts, which was a mix of technical (e.g. building and maintaining our website, handling QA and testing for all our releases) and non-technical work (blogposts, social media, partnerships). While I enjoy building product, I spend more of my free-time reading more about go-to-market strategies and tactics than purely technical content, and the most enjoyable part of my career so far has been seeing user growth. I'm trying to figure out the best way to position myself in my career. It's obvious I have more of a bend towards go-to-market than most engineers, so I want to figure out how I can best position myself in my career with these two skillsets. 
3) Charting a pathway into leadership. I've mostly worked at companies when there has been a very flat structure, so promotions and leadership opportunities were few and far between. I do believe that I have the soft skills and empathy to become a leader.  I want to get into leadership because it's much higher leverage, and can lead to higher impact. I'm also from Southeast Asia, which has a lot of technological growth ahead, and I believe that developing leadership experience will be hugely beneficial to any companies I work with in this region in the future.","Owning the entire marketing and documentation effort for Sourcegraph during our early days. In my first year at Sourcegraph, I built  all of our technical marketing assets, including our website and blog, from scratch. I managed all of our marketing efforts, which included content, partnerships with conferences, and grassroots marketing programs. I also built our documentation portal from scratch, which directly led to developers from major companies self-serving and installing our product for their orgs. This was all alongside shipping product features, and being the DRI for the success of our monthly releases, as well.

These efforts were during the earliest stages of my career, but that phase of ownership and effort is something I'm proud of because it led to us crossing the chasm from being a product for open source power users, to selling to major companies such as Uber; Lyft; and Nutanix, as our earliest customers. The feeling of hitting product-market fit was incredibly satisfying, and knowing that many of my efforts contributed to it is something I continue to be proud of today.","I believe that I have a ton of room to grow, and I'm willing to work hard to fulfill my potential. Through being an early employee at two startups, I've developed a breadth of skills and experiences on both the product/engineering and go-to-market sides. Now, it's about positioning myself to have the most impact, and honing into what roles or functions I can be most impactful in. 

I also am in a very unique position: though I started working in person in San Francisco, I've been working remotely for US companies from Singapore. I've been observing the differences between how companies operate across regions. By default, the US is ahead in most things, but there are also lessons that I believe companies in the US can take from operators in this region. Furthermore, I'm likely one of the most experienced people on earth in asynchronous communication and remote work, given I've been working in a timezone ~16 hours ahead of most of my company for the last 3 years. I've been told I'm highly effective at async, and I'd have many perspectives to share here.",,"I'd love to get paired with a mentor that comes from a technical background, and has experience coaching engineers. Ideally, this person has worked in both large companies and startups. This person ideally is in a leadership position today. Finally (and this one is very aspirational), this person would be someone who has moved between engineering and non-engineering roles. For example, someone who was in engineering but ended up as a product leader or a revenue leader (or vice-versa).

Of the things I want to develop, I'm most interested in taking my technical skills to the next level, and figuring out effective strategies for consistent technical growth. 

Then, I'd love my mentor to help me figure out how best to position myself given my breadth of skillsets / interests / experiences, which is why someone who has worked on both technical and non-technical sides would be interesting to speak to.

Finally, I would like to develop a path towards leadership positions and understanding how to position myself to get there. Hence, having someone in a leadership position would be helpful.",,,,Male,"Southeast Asian,Middle Eastern",1

Henry,Dowling,Mentee,No,,No,Associate Product Manager,Bubble,Operator,https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrydowling/,EST,New York,Product,"SaaS,Enterprise",1-2,0,101-500,"As a junior product manager, I’ve gotten a lot of opportunities to hone my execution skills, especially on small, “in the weeds” projects. This year, however, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to spend more time at my job thinking strategically about product management. I would like to be matched with a mentor who could help me develop a better framework for thinking about “big picture” product management. Here are some specific areas I am looking to learn more about:

- Aligning a long-term product strategy with business objectives.
- Effectively communicating and rallying a team around a shared product vision and inspiring them to work towards a common goal.
- Translating a long-term product strategy into actionable, measurable steps.","I am a junior PM on the infrastructure team at a small (~100-person) startup. Last year, the senior PM on the team unexpectedly left, leaving me as the sole PM while we searched for a replacement. The team had historically been underperformant. It suffered from a lack of clear project prioritization and as a result shifted focus often without making much headway on any individual project. Engineers were starting to feel burnt out and restless as a result. Furthermore, leadership was unable to fully understand the (often rather technical) nature of the projects the team was working on and provide much-needed guidance.

As the temporary lead PM for the team, I took steps to course-correct: I met with the engineers on the team to gain a better understanding of the costs and benefits of each project. I then documented these findings and presented them to key stakeholders, including leadership from engineering and product. Supported by estimates of cost and benefit for each project, I advocated for a shift in focus to two key, high-priority projects and worked to get the buy-in from the engineers.

The next quarter, the team shifted directions and I was excited to see great results. We began shipping code that was directly beneficial to the company’s most important business objectives, which provided a morale boost for both leadership and the engineers on the team. Engineering velocity went up, and as a bonus, users that I’ve talked to have been excited to hear about our new focus on these projects.

I am proud that I was able to help shift the direction of the engineering team and prioritize projects that were critical to the success of the company. As a PM, this is the type of impact I aim to have— to prioritize projects from a multitude of potential ideas and to empower my team to ship stuff that will have a big impact on business goals.","I’m at an exciting point in my career—I’m learning a lot about PMing in my current role at a great company and looking to make a decision about how to best advance my career from here. I’m junior enough that I have a lot of options and opportunities available— should I spend more time honing my IC skills? Should I try to push to transition to a more managerial role when appropriate? What about business school? What about founding? I’m really excited to work with a mentor because I don’t know what I don’t know right now about both product and the tech world in general. Guidance and advice from a mentor right now could be really impactful to the overall trajectory of my career, which I hope would be rewarding to a mentor.

Also, I have a somewhat unique perspective on PMing that I think could be interesting to a mentor of any experience level—I’m working as a PM on an engineering team that I previously worked on as an engineer. As a result, I have a lot more insight into the trade-offs that go into technical decision making than a typical PM, which has translated into some useful knowledge about how to think about prioritizing tech investment versus feature projects.",,"I would love to have a mentor who meets some of these characteristics:

- An experienced / senior product manager—I would love to be able to ask for advice on product questions
- Moved from an IC to managerial role—I’m interested in taking on more managerial roles later in my career
- Has gone to business school—This is a decision I’m weighing right now, and it would be helpful to me to have another perspective on this
- Has founded a company—This is another decision I’m considering right now that I would love to have insight on!",,,,Male,White,1

There was a lot I didn't know while taking on this job. I was uncomfortable for phases of it but I learned a lot along the way!","As a mid-career individual, I feel like I don't require as much handholding and explaining as someone earlier in their career would need.

1. thinking through how to balance the technical knowledge/skill accumulation vs product management skills, as well as which the best short term / long term career goal is for me. 
2.Thinking through both long-term and short-term product strategy. 
3. Learning how to build out a team. I've never managed someone before, and I'm trying to learn how to switch from an IC to a Manager.","I remember there was a time that our team was going to have a demo to C-suite level. Our team is going to demonstrate the capability of the next Gen checkout station. Since we are focusing on prototype, the technology and product we are going to demonstrate is not necessary to be perfect, but we at least need to Prove Of the Concept. The problem is that we are trying to use multiple sensors/signals to help customers to detect products automatically at the checkout station, which can save checkout time and improve throughput significantly. Also if there is some system Unrecognized product, we will ask the customer to hand scan that. But since our Computer vision technology is not mature enough during that time, it is hard to tell customers accurately what is unrecognized and where it is, and if giving customers a wrong instruction, the customer experience will be bad, so everyone is stuck over here.
 
Then I came up with a proposal, I was REVERSE THINKING the problem, since our system doesn’t has an accurate prediction on unrecognized items, but our system has a pretty good prediction on recognized items, so if we give customer these confident “recognized” instructions and ask them to bag them, all unrecognized items will be left on the station and people can start to hand scan them. Although it is not a perfect user experience, it is practical and achievable enough for the demo. Then I immediately presented my idea to our director, and I got his support. After that my idea was presented to multiple directors and senior directors, and we got all of them to buy in. Finally my idea was implemented into the demo and is carried on in the subsequent development.

","I think that knowledge sharing is also one of the important aspects of mentoring. I believe that although a mentor has a lot of experience, he still want to keep learning. So as a mentee, I can also keep my mentor informed by sending them articles or other resources that are relevant to shared interests, or recent conversations. For example, I can also recommend or connect my mentor to books, people, or other resources that they might find helpful/interesting and relevant to projects they’re working on. 
Other then this, I would also share the results they helped me to achieve, like let my mentor know when I received positive feedback from a project they’ve helped me with. 
Besides, I am willing to offer to help out with tasks. I can help with tasks that may not necessarily related to our mentorship relationship (e.g., volunteering to help plan or set up an event they’re hosting.) Because I believe that mentoring takes time, energy, so I really appreciate their help, I want to try my best to help my mentor in some way. 
Finally I think if possible, in the future I will have the chance to pass on the virtue and help another person achieve her goals.",,"Looking forward to meeting with a supportive, communicative, inspiring mentor, really appreciate it!",,,,Female,East Asian,1

Currently my main role is to work with the team on creating the content and functionality of our web app. Most likely as our team expands, I would be working on managing a tech team. I would like to understand how I can adjust to a managerial role from an IC, learn how to efficiently plan for meetings and projects, and how to resolve conflicts/keep the team motivated and working smoothly. 
I want to learn more about business planning, networking, and understanding of the market. I come from a tech background and am inexperienced with the business side of building a company ground up. As such, I’m most likely going to struggle the most on the managerial and logistical side and would like to know just how much I don’t know and build up on that. One of my career goals is to be a c-suite officer of a notable company, so I would like to get as much executive and managerial advice as I can. 
Finally, I would like to discuss strategy on product image. I want to understand how I can best make my product most appealing to my niche and ways to retain members as we grow. I believe understanding this would help guide me to make decisions on how the product should be designed on the technical side. ","My perhaps most important contribution to society would have to do with the work I did for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, a world pioneer in the life-saving bone marrow treatments and holder of 3 Nobel Laureates, as a computational biologist last summer. Knowing that I would be working with the best and the brightest in their respective fields, I came in with the goal of getting as much experience as possible and surrounding myself with a network of luminous people. I was paired with two mentors: Dr. Beverly Torok-Stork, world-renowned for her contributions to the bone marrow Nobel Prize and stem cell research, and Dr. Phil Bradley, a computational biologist and leading figure of the de novo protein design. While working here, I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Lee Hartwell to inquire about his Nobel Prize winning work at the Hutch and Dr. Fauci during a conference. Under these amazing, inspiring people, I learned what is required to be a cancer researcher in immunology and worked on my own research in patient cell behavior in response to various mice T-Cell receptors to synthesize a cure. 
I made an action plan from the start: in the first week, I would be meeting all the faculty, so I put in the extra effort in attending social events, having lunch with colleagues, and joining event planning committees. I knew as a new hire, first impressions can make-or-break my overall experience. By the end of the week, I understood exactly what my job requires of me. My mentors were busy for most of the day and only had time for short check-ins and progress updates. If I had a problem with my code or were stuck on a concept, I would have to figure it out myself or ask my colleagues for their advice. Understanding that my time with my mentors was limited, I wrote down a list of topics and agendas I wanted to discuss with them as I worked before each meeting; at the end of each work day, I left them an email of what I was able to accomplish and what I will try to do next. So, I fell into a regular routine of working overtime for at least a few hours every day and on the commute back, reading documentation and scientific articles. 
And it paid off. Before I left for college, I presented to 75+ renowned scientists on the cumulative work I had done over the entire summer and was rewarded with a $2000 scholarship. A promotional video for the Fred Hutch Undergraduate Internship Program that I volunteered to supervise and edit was received with high praise and uploaded to Fred Hutch’s Youtube Channel. I was left proud of my accomplishments under the guidance of great and understanding people, happy with the people I got to know closely in and out of the workspace, and hungry to explore more into immunology and research. ","I want to become an entrepreneur because I believe that the best way to leave an impact on the world is to do it yourself. As a kid, I liked putting in milk before cereal, because that was the way I preferred my cereal. I’m not satisfied in simply accepting the status quo just because that was the way everyone did it. When I’m dedicated to making something happen, I put all my energy in making it a reality. A mentor that is paired with me would be more than satisfied with the high quality planning and dedication I would bring regularly to our meetings. When someone talks, I actively listen and ask questions. My mentor would gain a different perspective from me and hopefully would be able to learn something. They wouldn’t have to worry about what is going on in my end because I will actively be journaling my progress to update my mentor during the meeting every two weeks. ",,"The first thing I would tell my Mentor is that I am going to be direct and honest with them and that I would request the same of them. I’d rather have someone tell me that my idea wouldn’t work and they would rather see something else than sweetly agreeing with me. Ideally, I would like someone who is personable, approachable, and willing to talk about more than just business. I place value in getting to know a person other than their accomplishments such as their wisdom, experiences, and value. If the Mentor is an entrepreneur who came from a tech background, that would also be great because that is something I would like to connect with someone and learn how they were able to use their tech skills for the company and how they were able to gain business skills necessary for management.

Keshia,Naurana Badalge,Mentee,No,,No,Chief of Staff,Matter (getmatter.com),Operator,https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshianb/,Other,Singapore - but I work in PST so meetings shouldn't be a problem!,Chief of Staff Role,Consumer,5-6,3-5,6-10,"I'm employee #2 on my team, a read-it-later app. Employee #1 has been promoted to junior co-founder, and I'm excited to see how I can grow my career too! Here's what I'm looking to work on:

1) How to work with an engineering-focused team as an operator. My team is majority male, majority engineers. I lead a smaller team, and I manage all the females on the team, all of whom are operators. Last year, all the men on the team got a cost of living adjustment/salary increase, but all the women (myself and the people I manage) did not. I'd like to learn to be a better advocate for myself and the people on my team. How can I be respected and heard and listened to as an operator?

2) Time management: Do people really work 8 hours a day? I find myself working throughout the day, because there is so much to get done, but I can't be productive for so many hours of the day. I find I am most productive for about 4-5 hours a day, and I have even told my boss that I would like to go part-time because I can only meaningfully contribute 4-5 hours a day. Is this a kind of self-sabotage, where I am taking a paycut for no reason? I'd like to be coached about how to handle expectations of time spent at work, because now that I am going part-time, I am paid half my salary, but I still continue to work the 4-5 hours a day that I've always been working. Am I just not savvy? I'd like to learn how to be smarter about how to present my productivity to my boss and work hours, especially now that I have learnt that many other productive teammates also predominantly only work about 5 hours a day.

3) Systems as a Chief of Staff: I'd love to learn the best systems for an all-encompassing generalist chief of staff, such as: the best CRM to use for the journalists in our network, growth strategies (Is it helpful to write a newsletter? Have an instagram/tiktok presence, as a media-leaning company?), how to keep track of praise from customers about the work I am doing, how to keep track of what I am learning, how to keep track of all the ideas that come up that we want to implement, the apps and software that are suggested to us for our team to use/try. I'd like to improve my operating system.","Owning curation. Curation is part of Matter's brand. I feel fortunate to be able to play a role in influencing our users, by recommending them articles to read, serving personal recommendations, and elevating writers. It is akin having access to someone's brain and their cognitive landscape! Curation takes up 1 screen in the app, the other screens are for your queue and your subscriptions. I've singlehandedly managed our curation and weekly roundup for the past 3 years. The weekly roundup, which is a curated pick of the best of the week, reaches about 100,000 users and has a 75-80% open rate. And I write it from this small, little desk in Singapore! I'm so happy to be able to share my reading list and the best writing with users all around the world, and be able to influence their ideas, and spread ideas that matter, in my own way.","Apart from working as a Chief of Staff, on the weekends, I write! I used to work as a journalist and have reported from over 30 countries around the world, for places such as the World Economic Forum, Bloomberg, The Atlantic, The Washington Post and Quartz. I am now working on a non-fiction book on Modern Slavery and (secret!) I have a pretty big, 7-figure publishing deal! I know that some people are uniquely interested or enjoy working with writers, and I think that a mentor who is interested in writing, journalism, and publishing big books would love to know this other side of me too!

Apart from that, I'm a female Singaporean working from Singapore, and working for a very well-respected app. We count Marc Andressen, Tobi Lutke, Oliver Burkeman, Oleg Stavitsky, John O'Nolan, Patrick Collison, Tamara Winter, Molly Mielke and Nathan Baschez among our users. If a mentor is interested in working with someone outside of the U.S., who has a non-traditional experience (coming from journalism!) and has professional relationships and communications with some very thoughtful and smart people in the industry, I'd be that person!",,"I'd love a mentor like Brie Wolfson. Early in my job at Matter, Brie came on as a consultant. Her role was to mentor and onboard me and work with me (I was their first non-engineering hire, and employee #2, so we had to do a lot of setting up of the systems that persist today.) She did such a great job teaching me how to be seen (eg. write notes and agendas, share them with your manager, keep a doc of what you are learning and praise that others give you.) 

I have a tendency to curl up and be small instead of calling attention to myself, and I notice that a lot of the work that I do does not get noticed because I do not express or show it well. I'd love a mentor who is confident and bold and encouraging, who can encourage me to mirror their patterns of thought and action and give me templates and frameworks on how to present myself in a workplace.",,,,Female,"Southeast Asian,South Asian",1

I only learned about UX design in fall 2020, and it was such a light bulb moment for me as I realized much of the work I did was an educator aligned with the field of UX— understanding human behavior, data-informed decision making, working within constraints, continually iterating based on data, etc. I followed my curiosity, and that led me to an incredible internship opportunity, which led to a full time position upon completion of the internship. It all happened rather quickly, and I’m proud of my ability to assess risk, ask the right questions to the right people, seek out and follow the wisdom of people who were in the position I wanted to be in, and overall trusting my ability to see this career change through.

3) I look forward to gaining mentorship and guidance on my next career milestone: being a Senior PM. Furthermore, I would love insight on choosing between staying an IC versus becoming a people manager. ","At a philosophical level, my biggest accomplishment in my career has been discovering and working in the realm of work that makes every day fulfilling. I have always been an extremely curious person. Growing up and through college, this curiosity created a unique problem for me - what was I truly passionate about? I liked mythology as much as I like macroeconomics. To ""keep my options open"" and ""find what interests me most from a wide range of projects"", my first job out of college was in strategy consulting. While it was engaging and taught me a lot, I knew it wasn't what I saw myself doing every day for the rest of my life. But then I stumbled upon building technology products - and I was obsessed. I broke into product and at startup and the scrappy, challenging, chaotic energy of startup life has kept me hooked. 

I definitely have quantifiable accomplishments like the coveted promotion, the successful product launch and the time when the CEO entrusted me with 2 of the highest revenue generating products. But to me, that's just part of the larger accomplishment which is that I am able to keep my brain wired and happy at all times by having found something that energizes me every single day. ","I believe mentorship is a two way street - both mentor and mentee should learn something from the experience. I think a mentor would be excited to work with me because I will strive to provide them with 2 things to walk away with. They are - 
- I will be 100% engaged in the program and in the sessions, proactively bringing challenging questions to my mentor. This hopefully helps them reflect on their own experiences to answer my questions, maybe discovering something about themselves they hadn't before. I hope to make them feel fulfilled about mentoring me by studying their insights and relaying back to them when I use their strategies. 
- I will stay committed to connecting beyond the program. I believe all focused startup operators intend on growing beyond these programs whether that's to work at each other's future startups or invest in them! I'll make a concerted effort to help my mentor through any/ all of these activities! 
At the highest level, a mentor would be excited to work with me if they are intrigued by someone who is fiercely ambitious, focused and sincere.

Since then, he has tried everything that the standard of care has to offer, including dozens of medications and life-threatening brain surgery. Unfortunately, nothing has worked for him. A few years ago, he started having more seizures than ever — up to 30 seizures per day. Determined to solve his problem, I transitioned from my previous career to studying the molecular mechanisms of brain disorders at Harvard Medical School (HMS), with the goal of doing whatever I can to help my little brother and other children who suffer from FCD and diseases of similar etiologies.

After three productive years spent co-authoring several published and forthcoming papers on bioinformatic algorithms that facilitate insights into the fields of brain disorders and cancer, I was granted the autonomy to work on a novel, independently-conceived potential therapeutic avenue for my little brother’s disease. Since then, managing a team of interns, I completed a comprehensive in silico validation of the proposed therapy and independently secured intellectual property for the invention via Harvard’s Office of Technology Development. Thereafter, I assembled an accomplished and dedicated team with complementary skill sets. Together, we have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in dilutive and non-dilutive funding and won over a dozen awards.","Having witnessed the shortcomings of the current standard of care, I am deeply motivated to develop therapies that could truly make a difference to patients suffering from genetic diseases like FCD.

","I don't have that long of a career, however I'm proud of being successful and constantly raising the bar while growing my entrepreneurial nature. I was the youngest 4th degree black belt in the entire MMA Kukkiwon organization (may still be, not sure) that my master had to fly to South Korea to get special approval for me to even test for my black belt in which I was 2/3 of the people who passed the grueling exam. I was an IB diplomat student in high school and graduated with honors & as a full time student athlete. By my junior year of college I had a profitable career trading equities ($82k), when I walked away to build my first company, a methane solid oxide fuel cell company as a means to stopping climate change. I organized a team of engineers & we built prototype designs for our fuel cell and pitched investors. While no investor bit, the main critique was I wasn't an engineer and didn't have the skills to build a hardtech energy company. And they were partly right, while I didn't have the engineering knowledge I certainly had the curiosity and capability to understand and learn it. So as I engrossed myself into reading more energy research I became a venture capitalist at VU Venture Partners where I was able to learn how investors thought. Learn the unwritten laws, and start building a network while directly learning from first/early investors in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Paypal, etc. I invested in 10 companies from my trading career profits, and started leading teams at the Luminosity Lab at ASU at the start of my senior year. The Luminosity Lab is a $100M skunkworks lab that's largely responsible for why ASU has been consistently the #1 school of innovation for the last 8 years beating MIT & Stanford. Here I led 3 teams: Gridbase - a DC/AC cost-effective microgrid to deploy in 3rd world countries to boost the rural grids & provide energy; Aquatio - a CO2 based wastewater desalination system; X-prize: Vertical bamboo farms within abandoned elevator shafts. While this was ongoing I met my now, CEO at an ASU pitch competition where he was pitching EarthEn and won the competition. I officially left the Luminosity Lab and joined EarthEn at the start of 2022, and have been full time since I graduated with 3 degrees in Neuroscience, Supply Chain Management & Management in May. I'm proud of the hard work & resiliency that I implemented in my past and look to combine my skills & innovation-seeking curiosity to build EarthEn into the next energy empire. Bill Gates said out of this cleantech era 8-10 Amazons, Teslas, Microsofts will emerge. EarthEn will be one of those 10. ","I'm an extremely ambitious, curious problem-solver. My friends call me a fixer, because it's how my brain operates - which is what attracted me to climate change. I reject conventional notions, and am always thinking outside the box and trying to reinvent the wheel in hopes to build the optimal solution. While I'm not an engineer by trade, I was raised by engineers and grew up around many (my godparents & godbrothers, father & best friends are engineers), and thus usually approach problems and situations from a first-principle pov. I'm a straight shooter, and open minded with a growth mindset. I'm extraverted & used to be a professional MMA fighter for 11 years. Here I was instilled values that I still carry & employ today: courage, discipline, integrity, perseverance, indomitable spirit & victory.

3) Branding: how to position a brand and communicate a clear message when having 2 different marketplace's targets: sellers and shoppers.","For five years I visited rural communities, where the main problem was lack of access to drinking-water. While studying Chemical Engineering, together with 3 friends, we were able to run a social project, providing water to 2 communities in the outskirts of my hometown in Mexico.
We developed cacti-based water purification tablets, which removed heavy metals and pollutants from water.
It was amazing to see how the people in the community not only got less sick, but also improved other nutritious and health habits.","At my startup, 1) my co-founder and I have just started to run the startup, 2) we need to analyze, define and execute as fast as we can as we are self-funded, therefore:
- Advice we get, advice we look forward to implement and evaluate as soon as possible. Together with my mentor we will be able to see results and action, not only concepts.

2. Branding/Content: I dont think we are doing a good job explaining what we do clearly and how it works, and creating a powerful brand around sustainability/value

3) How do we build a competitive moat over time?","At McKinsey, I saw an opportunity to leverage my Solution Architecture skills from Anaplan (my job prior to consulting) to build a tool in the Anaplan software that would automate McKinsey's client work.

Most of my work at McKinsey was focused in the private equity practice where I ran diligences to discover revenue and cost opportunities across portfolio companies. In McKinsey's ""analog"" method, we would run 8-12 week projects to sift through millions of financial transactions in a jungle of spreadsheets to find opportunities.

I approached a few partners with the idea of building an application in Anaplan that would ingest millions of records in minutes, automatically categorize transactions to McKinsey's benchmarking taxonomy and run a series of benchmarks + analytics across the P&L to automatically generate opportunity sizes. 

Although they thought I was crazy, they gave me a small budget to design/architect this concept (as a side project). I managed a team of 3 Anaplan developers to build this application, and within 3 months we had a client ready MVP. Fast forward 2 years - this tool evolved into the gold standard in McKinsey Private Equity Practice to run diligences and reduced project timelines from 8-12 weeks to 2-4 weeks. 

Suddenly, partners wanted me on every client proposal showcasing how the tool enabled our teams to get quick, data driven answers to develop a baseline for transformation programs. It set us apart tremendously from competing firms and in many cases was the reason we would win projects.

It was pretty amazing to see myself walk into McKinsey with a deep sense of imposter syndrome, and walk out of the Firm with the realization that my creativity was able to change how one of the world's most well respected institutions supports some of the world's largest organizations.","I'm an incredibly hungry + curious individual that wants to spend the rest of my life building software companies.

My beta version is almost complete and I'm stuck trying to figure out the best way to roll this out. I'm mainly looking for help with these three themes paired with some of my most hot, burning questions for each:

1) Making sure my business foundation is solid by going through somewhat of a basic financial & legal checklist of sorts. The last thing I want is to deal with a lawsuit or some legal action preventing me from moving forward. ""How should I be tracking my financials for tax purposes?"" and ""What trademarks should I be filing for to protect my business and idea?""

2) Prioritizing and executing long-term and short-term growth strategies. I need to learn how to set realistic, impactful goals that will help me move forward. ""In order to grow, what changes should I begin thinking about making, and in what order?"" ""How do I cut through the noise and begin prioritizing and focusing on one thing at a time?""

3) Go-to-Market strategy and planning. Now that I'm ready to introduce this site to users, what should I be working on? ""How do I begin building hype and spreading the word while it's still in beta? ""How do I market this product and make others excited and engaged with it when it isn't completely perfect yet?""

Catherine,Xu,Mentee,No,,No,Founder,Starlight,Founder,https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-y-xu/,EST,New York City,Product,"FinTech,GovTech,SaaS",3-4,0,1-5,"I'm a founder of a social impact tech company. We are early stages (5 months into our journey) and have received some pre-seed funding. Prior to this role, I was a product manager at LinkedIn for several years. I'd like to work on: 
1. How to prioritize, build, and validate products quickly in a startup environment
2. How to validate business models and find funding where incentives are aligned 
3. How to build a founding team and motivate them toward a shared goal in early stages","I'm incredibly proud of the journey I've taken so far to build out my current company, Starlight. It started a couple months after I'd left my first job at LinkedIn. I had the vague goal of wanting to work on social impact problems, and build technology for communities that were historically underserved, and decided to moved out of Silicon Valley, where I'd been my whole life, and across the country, in order to embed myself in those communities and problems. 

Within a month, I found some volunteer work with a council member's office in Bed Stuy Brooklyn, and was able to see firsthand the grassroots work being done to tackle community challenges. I also formed a founding team. 

However, we faced challenges as a team, especially in the face of ambiguity. We often got stuck overthinking, wondering if XYZ would work, and with a larger team of 4, it was hard to prioritize and pivot. We got along as friends and had shared values, but weren't necessarily the best cofounders because of different tolerance for risk and working styles. 

When we eventually decided to part ways, I thought I had failed. I looked at my peers who were part of the same accelerator as we were, and felt a mix of anxiety and embarrassment; they seemed to be getting so much traction in comparison to us. 

I took a couple days to think and reflect, and was reminded of a line a friend who was an actor once told me: ""If you want to make it in Hollywood, you have to fall in love with auditioning, not acting."" In other words, fall in love with the process, not the results. I thought about the process - of building and learning new things - which I knew I enjoyed, in spite of our founding team not working out. 

I got back on my feet and started building again, this time trying not to get stuck in the paralysis of thought. I familiarized myself with a suite of low-code and no-code tools, and spun up a new prototype in a week. At the same time, two companies saw our work, and reached out to partner with us, landing us partnerships the following week, through which we were able to reach 50+ users. The traction secured pre-seed funds for us from Robin Hood Foundation - all within a month. 

The experience was a great learning in resilience, diligence, and a bit of trusting my own instincts and abilities. While I still stumble day-to-day, I think back on this particular part of my journey and get back to work. ","1. I'm eager for coaching. Working on my own company at this early stage often means that I'm either working alone or with just a handful of other people. I often think back to my times at LinkedIn, where mentorship was plentiful and structured, and miss that in this startup environment. While I learn a lot from other founders around me, I believe direct mentorship from someone who has been on this journey many times and isn't in the trenches, would provide a valuable and different perspective. 
2. I follow through. If you looked at my personal Notion, you would find pages where I keep lists for every book/movie/article that close friends or colleagues have suggested I look into or that I would like. I regularly go through this list (the time to do so is a weekly hold in my calendar). It may be a lot, but I use this as one example of my firm belief in accountability to myself and others. All this to say, your time and insights as a mentor are valuable to me and I want to honor that by being coachable and accountable. I'd hope it would be rewarding for you to see me grow as well. 
3. I have a lot of activities/interests outside of my job (including for instance, running a coaching business of immigrant parents on how to better communicate with their kids). I think regularly about how to incorporate these other interests into my work life, and broadly, the role of work in life. Might be fun to ruminate on some of these larger, non-tactical questions together as well.

My goal is to build a community of parents that would become evangelists of our solution. With my mentor I would like to discuss:
1. ways of community building 
2. how to use the community in a B2B business model (selling the solution to schools) ","I have led national mental health initiatives providing access to care for thousands of children and university students. 
Being on the board of a large NGO, I carried out work on the establishment of mental health support centers. Successfully obtained funding for free psychological consultations for students. 
After my term at the NGO ended, when I founded Calmsie, I continued to support the project by providing free access to the telemedicine platform we created. 
I was able to build a business - Calmsie - around mental health activities, for which I was included in the Forbes 25 under 25 list.","The Calmsie's and my story began with a telemedicine platform for psychiatrists, from which the need for chatbots arose. Observing how engaging they were with patients, after talking to dozens of doctors, we developed a solution that would address a niche - children's mental health. We have three doctors on the team who address medical issues and an in-house technical team.

During the Covid crisis, we saw an increase in mental health issues as well as an increased awareness of the scope of the problem. Consumers readily adopted digital health platforms to allow for virtual consultations. Adult consumers also began to embrace AI driven solutions like Woebot’s, Wysa’s, and Limbix’s chatbot driven therapy models to manage low mood, anxiety, and addiction.

Calmsie takes this a step further with AI driven therapeutic videobots to create personalized app based therapy conversations in a game platform for children. This has traditionally been a difficult population to treat digitally. However, through our gamified approach, we engage users and our videobots develop rapport in a way that makes children enjoy returning to therapy each day.

Today’s generation of children are the very first to grow up in a completely connected environment. Many children spend a significant amount of time on their devices for the purposes of entertainment, education, and communication. We include therapy into this list through our serious game platform as we provide treatment and prevention exactly where a majority of children now focus their attention. It is important that we teach children how to use technology responsibly so that they can use it to learn, communicate, be productive, and stay healthy.

We know that our product is needed because all stakeholders - children, parents, doctors/therapists - created it with us.

I believe that a mentor will be persuaded to work with me by the mission of the project I lead. Every day I want to become better and better, and I believe that with the support of a mentor I will be able to develop not only the community around Calmsie, but also my character and personal skills.",,"I am looking for a mentor who will believe in my startup and help me better understand its needs.

I am now in the process of confirming product market fit and would love to have a mentor to discuss the following topics:
1.	Advertising – AVID is an affiliate marketing opportunity which will require large amounts of traffic driven to the site to ultimately monetize on ads. I would like to discuss with a mentor how best to effectively establish SEO/paid campaigns/guerilla marketing campaigns with the goal of avoiding throwing dollars into the black hole of marketing without ROI. Currently I am focused on testing small paid ads in the NYC region to confirm product market fit and iterate on AVID from there.
2.	Product development– To date, I have had 2 reseller platforms (StubHub & SeatGeek) integrated via API who provide certain data points, not including individual ticket listings. Similarly, future resellers to be integrated such as Ticketmaster have differing end points, whilst some do not even have APIs. I foresee as AVID expands going forward, the risk of being tied to Partner data may be too high which will require us to diversify beyond reliance on outside APIs. I've explored whether scraping would be a feasible option but would welcome feedback in this area. My hypothesis is that this product existed to a certain extent in the past so we should be able to re-create it at the bare minimum, and make it better 5-10 years later.
3.	Overall business strategy – To be transparent, I’ve found my first startup journey to be a lonely one even after having developed a network over the years.  I’m looking for a mentor that will support from a mastermind perspective so I can generally inquire on ideas and actions I am taking for a sober second thought.
","Prior to taking this entrepreneurial path, I worked at a consultancy that led me to move from Edmonton, Canada to NYC in 2017. I was part of a two-person team that supported the global expansion of a profit center from $450M to $1B in annual revenues over 4 years. We did this through relentless connecting and support of firms across every region of the world which included individual strategy and go-to-market development with senior partners, talent/learning activities and service offering development amongst other things. I am proud of this 4 year period as it helped lay the foundation of my current skillset which I do not believe I would have achieved had I stayed home. Moreover I was able to see our two-person shop grow to over 15 people, some of which being the most impressive people I have have been lucky to work with.","I hope a mentor would be excited to work with me as: 
- I have a specific idea which has already been built that solves a problem that I experience myself and believe others are as well
- I am flexible to iterate on my product to determine how it can maximize value
- AVID is being built in the sports industry which is fast growing with many opportunities for value capture. The secondary ticket reseller industry is expected to have grow from $3B at a ~16% CAGR to $8B by 2028.

I was working within the Goldman Sachs sustainability business at the time and I kept asking myself: ""How can we create systemic change by tying progress on racial equity to outcomes powerful stakeholders already care about?"" 


The question led to an idea and then a vision for the ""Municipal Issuer Racial Equity Engagement Strategy"" an asset manager questionnaire that asks local governments to share their progress on racial equity — as part of the due diligence assessment for new government bond offerings.

I presented the strategy to Partners & senior leaders at Goldman Sachs, and the idea was not only enacted by Goldman — BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and Vanguard signed on as well.

Being an HRBP draws quite a lot of parallels to Product Management. A product manager in any startup doubles as an employee and having the opportunity to thought partner on how the People function can adopt product mgmt principles simply by drawing on their lived experiences as an employee will be a really interesting and intellectual space to play as a mentor to help guide me into enacting change (and perhaps developing an interesting product solve).

ii) project management with different knowledge/background (currently, I'm leading an ESG project, and I'm working with people from different areas and hierarchies)
iii) how to embed ""sustainability"" in a software product (green product)","My greatest accomplishment was creating an M&A area at ZENVIA. I was invited by the CEO to lead the area, and he gave me a free hand to do what I needed to do. Before me, there was not a proper process aligned with the strategy and the ""make-it-or-buy"" decisions, no documentation and track record with the potential acquisitions, and no commitment by the product, tech, and marketing operators.
What I did was to: i) establish a process with triggers to pass to each new phase, and add responsible in each step; ii) organize all our thesis, and propose new ones according to what I see in the market; iii) nurture our relationship with the companies; iv) implement a CRM
Today, the process is running well. Because of the accomplishment, I've learned a lot about Zenvia's strategy which gave me the opportunity to create our first Vertical Thesis (End-to-end CX for Education); go to SaaStr in San Francisco to understand the concepts to apply at Zenvia and be the responsible for the new project that is not part of the operations (e.g. creation and implementation of the ESG).","I can contribute with my different background. I'm a very curious and observant person. I'm 25, Brazilian, the granddaughter of Japanese immigrants, and a bit of Millenium and gen Z. I'm passionate about technology and sports (including footvolley, a typical Brazilian sport). 
I love to contribute my opinion about everything, especially if it's a consumer good. The Mentor would be excited to hear them!
Adding to that, the mentor would be excited to work with me because I'm very dedicated and I really take into consideration all advice that I receive. Thus, the mentor would see that his mentorship really paid off. ",,,,,,Female,Hispanic/Latinx,0

3. Is intentional about my growth: While I appreciate a chill mentor, I also want someone who is intentional about my growth and development as a designer. This means someone who is willing to challenge me, give me constructive feedback, and hold me accountable for my progress.

4. Is available and responsive: I would like my mentor to be someone who is available and responsive when I need them. This means someone who is willing to schedule regular meetings, respond to my emails or messages in a timely manner, and make time for me when I need their guidance or support.

Overall, I believe that a mentor who is approachable, intentional, and available will be the most effective at helping me grow as a designer. While a chill and relaxed personality is appreciated, I also want someone who is dedicated to helping me achieve my goals and become the best designer I can be.

The main new initiative I am taking on this year is to build out our Startup Program, as Retool intends to invest heavily into startup marketing as a dedicated segment. I'd love a brainstorming partner in: 
- Understanding segmented marketing and community building for startups 
- Building lifecycle loops across email, in-app notifs, push notifs, etc
- Experience taking something 0-1 to market and getting tons of org buyin
- Thinking through cross-functional collaboration and with devopers, PMs, analytics, and so on
- Empathizing with startups and how we can become a tool in their arsenal for operational success","For the first few years, paid ads have been the main way we drive product signups and sales demos at Retool—and I built them! As our first dedicated growth marketer, I've worked on and owned Google ads, Bing ads, Developer sponsorships, influencer marketing, content syndicates, Facebook ads, Linkedin ads.. and some more. :) 

It's been a wild ride with a lot of bumps and several pretty uncomfortable stretches. I was pushed to solve problems (big and small!) with no playbook. Examples: 
- (small problem) What's the right reverse ETL tool for us?
- (massive problem) How do we build and launch Account Based Marketing in a week?
