I have industry expertise in FinTech, though I think the company-scaling lessons are industry agnostic. Functionally, most of my background is in marketing (though I've done very little marketing the last 5 years - my role there was executing on, and then building teams for, BD, Customer Support & Operations, and People.) I left my COO role at the end of 2022 (sabbatical? retired? -- TBD), and am looking for opportunities to give back and to stay connected to startup-land, in addition to my advisory and board work. If you surveyed everyone at Wisetack and asked what my biggest impact was, i think the consensus would be that I built the company ""thoughtfully and with intention,"" as one employee told me, while also tripling headcount in a year (and we didn't do layoffs), as well as being the person most responsible for company culture (though IMHO, the CEO is always the person most responsible for company culture - it's just that employees don't always see this). Those lessons in smart scaling are hard-won, which is why I'd prefer being paired with a founder, though since my role was COO, I'd also be happy being paired with an early-stage COO. Working on marketing problems is less interesting to me, but I do have 15 years of marketing experience that I can also draw from. I am most interested in companies that have a product which creates a positive impact in the world, very broadly defined -- absolutely not talking about a nonprofit or an education startup but i just want something i can feel good about helping grow (e.g. at Wisetack, our loans were a more responsible financial product than credit cards, and helped people finance important things like plumbing services or major dental work; things I have less interest in, e.g. is gaming, crypto.)

In terms of past accomplishments: 
- 2 exits (Modern Fertility, HookLogic)
- Former Founder (Norka Health, a fertility benefits company) 
- Both payer and provider experience 
- Full sales cycle experience (sales all the way through account management)
- Department head / past experience growing a BD team to 11 people 
- Market entry strategy (the chicken and egg of needing to hire on the ground resources without full market flywheel in place)",,,,,"I would love to mentor a CEO, Sales or BD operator at a company whose revenue / growth / partnership strategy depends on navigating a complex B2B organization and whose product may be B2B or B2B2C. 

The company doesn't have to be in healthcare but I would be especially helpful to someone navigating payers (health plans, employers) and / or health plans and other medical providers. Healthcare companies with these growth dynamics operate in a unique market. Regardless, any B2B company faces a challenging (i.e. long and complex) sales cycle. I've previously sold software into large retailers like Walmart and Target as well. I understand B2B sales and partnerships dynamics and can advise not only on prioritization and strategy but on managing the day to day dynamics of objections and building trust, finding the right decision makers and building the business case, having the right materials and data to do so, creating pilots, structuring contracts, managing the sales funnel and process, handing off to account management or implementation, cross-selling / upselling / expanding. 

I particularly love companies that deliver products or services direct to the consumer or patient. For example, Groups Recover Together is a national value-based outpatient opioid addiction treatment provider.  Flourish Care, whom I advise, is a doula services company serving mostly Medicaid members. Both are enabled by great, home-grown digital products but are primarily innovating on clinical models and care delivery. Modern Fertility (sold to Ro) provided digital diagnostics and healthcare products direct-to-consumer. HookLogic (sold to Criteo) was the creator of Sponsored Products, a paid search technology now ubiquitous on almost every retail site. 

I would also welcome digital products and services that sell just to B2B and don't require consumer acquisition (B2B2C) such as a software or services company selling into health systems / payers/ providers / retailers / any complex large organization  

If the company is thinking about value based contracts with health plans at any point, I can advise there as well (my full time job at the moment is structuring and negotiating value based contracts and Medicaid and Commercial health plans across 25 states). ",,Female,Other,0
